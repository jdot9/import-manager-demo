# UI Extensions Dev Server

This package is a development server library for HubSpot UI Extensions. It provides a Vite and Express-powered server for local development of extensions, which is run via the HubSpot CLI. There is also a `remoteBuild` function, used by Artifactor to generate production builds of extensions.

## Installation

You can install the package directly to run the CLI command to execute the production build locally:

```bash
npm install @hubspot/ui-extensions-dev-server
```

However, most people will use this package indirectly via the [HubSpot cli](https://git.hubteam.com/HubSpot/hubspot-cli-private):

```bash
hs project dev
```
