/**
 * Extracts the value from a given AST node based on its type.
 * This function handles various node types such as Literal, Identifier (aka variables), ArrayExpression,
 * ObjectExpression, SpreadElement, TemplateLiteral, UnaryExpression, and MemberExpression (accessing props on objects).
 * It also supports nested structures and handles special cases like undefined, NaN, and Infinity.
 *
 * It does not handle function calls, complex expressions, or anything that requires evaluation of code logic.
 * This is not a full JavaScript interpreter, but rather a utility to extract static values from the AST.
 *
 * Use this function carefully, as it assumes that the AST is well-formed and that the node types are as expected.
 * Many types are not yet supported. Anything this function is used for should have a backup runtime evaluation,
 * or be set up to fail gracefully if parsing fails.
 *
 * @param node - The AST node from which to extract the value.
 * @param state - The current state of the source code metadata, including variable declarations.
 * @returns An object containing the status of the operation, the extracted node value,
 *          or an error message if the extraction fails.
 *          The status can be 'SUCCESS' or 'FAIL'.
 *          If the status is 'SUCCESS', nodeValue will contain the extracted value.
 *          If the status is 'FAIL', error will contain the error message.
